    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>I started practing Jiu Jitsu when I was 19 years old living in Bentonville, AR. 
        I joined the gym there because I had always wanted to learn how a martial art and
        many podcasts talked about how great Jiu Jitsu is and boy were they right. But like
        many others, I fell in love with the sport on day one. Not only did I enjoy the sport aspect,
        but it also helped immensley in my job at the time as a jailer for the county sheriffs
        office. I found that very soon I was able to keep myself safe without having to use
        painful non-lethal tools such as pepper spray or a taser. These skills that I learned
        and continue to learnwere able to help keep me safe, and I want to give that to others.
        I am committed to teaching you self defense through jiu jitsu so that you can be confident
        in your abilities to defend yourself.</p>
