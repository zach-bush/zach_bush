        [We beleive in teaching everyone self defense because it is good for the mind and the body. 
        Our classes focus on using jujitsu and other grappling techniques to protect yourself when the 
        time comes. We beleive in any confrontational situation, walking/running away is always the safest option.
        It may not be the "coolest" thing to do, but it is the option that most often ensures your saftey and 
        wellbeing. However, if someone  grabs hold of you, you can no longer run. That is where jujitsu comes in.
        We will teach you how to be safe and be able to subdue your attacker/evade their attacks so you can 
        always come out on top.]

      <h3>[About Us]</h3>
      <p>
        [I have been training in jujitsu since 2019. I came into the sport because I was working at a sheriffs
        office and I wanted some more training so I could be safe on the job. It was then I decided to begin the 
        training and it changed my life. Not only were my body and mind healthier, but I found myself always able to 
        control my opponent when it came to physical altercation at work. This newfound level of control that
        I had gained not only made me safer, but the person I was subduing as well. I did not have to resort to
        other very painful less-lethal methods because I could control them safely with jujitsu. I then became a
        certified defensive tactics instructor and began to pass on my knowledge to others to help them in 
        the field. Now I am taking that training and passing it on to you in an effort to give everyone the tools
        to keep themselves safe, even when faced with dangerous circumstances.]
