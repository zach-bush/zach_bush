    <h2>Zach Bush</h2>
    <p> I am 22 years old and I grew up in California, though I now live in Rexburg. 
        I am married and have been for 2 years now. My wife's name is Leah and we 
        met in Arkansas, where she is from.</p>
        
    <p>I like to excersize and be outside if it is warm.
        I really do not like the cold though, so I am not looking forward to winter.
        I have been a member of the church all my life and served a mission in Ghana 
        Cape Coast. I am a Software Engineering Major and am taking this class to get better
         at website formatting.</p>
